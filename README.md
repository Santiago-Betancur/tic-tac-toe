# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Overview
This project is a simple tic-tac-toe game developed as a personal project to demonstrate web development skills using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. It features a retro 1980s aesthetic and allows two players to play tic-tac-toe on a single device.

## Features
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Play tic-tac-toe against another person.
- **Retro Style:** A design that echoes the 1980s gaming experience.
- **Responsive Design:** Works on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Game Restart:** Players can start a new game anytime with a "Play Again" feature.

## Development
The game logic is implemented in JavaScript, leveraging jQuery for DOM manipulation and event handling. The styling is done using CSS, with a grid layout for the game board.

### Winning Logic
The game checks for a winner after each move. It supports standard tic-tac-toe win conditions (three in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

### User Interface
The interface is straightforward, with a grid representing the game board and a display area for game messages (e.g., "Winner is X", "Draw!").

## Getting Started
To run the game locally:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Future Improvements
- Implement AI for single-player mode.
- Add sound effects and music to enhance the retro feel.
- Improve mobile responsiveness and touch support.

## Acknowledgments
- **jQuery:** Used for DOM manipulations and event handling.
- **GitHub:** Hosts the repository and pages for the live version of the game.
